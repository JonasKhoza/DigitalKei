    question: "Is Digital Kei a subscription?",
    answer: ` No. You shop with us just like in a 'regular' supermarket and you
            pay each time. There is therefore no obligation to order from us.
            Although of course we hope that you are so happy with your products
            that we will see you more often`,

    question: "What are the delivery times?",
    answer: `We deliver every evening throughout the Great Kei and
     to more and more places also in the morning and afternoon. 
     In the app you can see which delivery moments and times are available for your address.
      As soon as the delivery person is on his way, you will also receive a 'track & trace' link from us. 
      This way you know exactly what time we will be at your door.`,

    question: "Do I have to be home when Digital Kei delivers?",
    answer: `Preferably yes. This way, everything at home can go straight back into the fridge or freezer. 
    With the track & trace information we send you, you can see exactly what time we will be there. Are you unexpectedly not at home? Then contact the service team. We will call your delivery person. But please note: if you have alcohol in your order, we may ask for your ID. You can therefore not have your order delivered to your neighbors or have it placed somewhere else.
     If you are not at home, we unfortunately have to take your groceries back.`,

    question: "Is everything organic?",
    answer: `No, not all products are organic. The quality and freshness of what we sell is paramount.
     For some products, organic is the best choice.
      If something is (certified) organic, you will see this in the product information in the app.
       But there are plenty of products that are also well put together and taste great without that label.
        Many of our growers are based in the Great Kei, so we know well what they do to ensure that they can supply us with high-quality products.
         An organic label is not feasible for every grower, because costs and administrative work are also involved, but this does not mean that they have less good standards.`,
